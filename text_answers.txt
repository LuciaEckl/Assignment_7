• What is the defining property of Gaussian noise?
The probability density function (pdf) is the defining property of Gaussian noise. (http://www.dspguide.com/ch2/6.htm, last access: 08.06.2018). The bell shaped pdf is generated by signals which are formed from random processes (http://www.dspguide.com/ch2/5.htm, last access: 08.06.2018). It is also known as a Gauss distribution, a normal distribution or a Gaussian after the German mathematician Karl Friedrich Gauss.(http://www.dspguide.com/ch2/5.htm, last access: 08.06.2018) 
• What does a low-pass filter do in general?
A low-pass filter blocks the frequencies above the cutoff frequency (also called stopband) while all frequencies below can pass (called passband) (http://www.dspguide.com/ch3/4.htm, last access: 08.06.2018).
• Is a moving average filter a low-pass or a high-pass filter? Why?
The moving average filter is due to its slow roll-off and stopband attenuation a low-pass filter (http://www.dspguide.com/ch15/3.htm, last access: 08.06.2018).
